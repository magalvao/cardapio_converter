# cardapio_converter
A simple Java GUI app that converts the restaurant menu (written in a XLS spreadsheet) and converts it to a JSON in a spelcific format, ready to be used in CardapioJJ.

## Todo List:
* Make a better UI
* Make a JSON result window (instead of throwing everyting in the console)
* Make a preview of the cells to give the user the option to choose the cells to be converted.
